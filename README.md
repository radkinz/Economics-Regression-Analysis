# Economics Regression Analysis

For my Economics and Business Principles class, we were tasked with creating a scatterplot. I decided to take the project one step further by utilizing R and ggplot 
to make a user responsive web application that generates a scatter plot mapping GDP per capita against life expectancy for each continent of years from 1952 to 2007.

## Data Collection

I utilized the gapminder library to access a large dataset of countries' GDP and life expectancies. 

## UI

The slider allows the user to see the new data for each year, and there is also a button on the slider to animate through all years.
